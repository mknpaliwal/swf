<p>Friends,  with a noble intention we created SANKALP is formed by us and we do not know where this path may lead to but we will certainly try to leave a successful trail for others to follow. We are planning to do lots of activities in future initially in and around Balkum area and subsequently the same will be spread to the other area of Thane and Maharashtra but our stated objective cannot be achieved or possible without your active guidance and support from friends like you as we strongly believe “coming together is a beginning for us, staying and working together us will be success for SANKALP”. </p>
